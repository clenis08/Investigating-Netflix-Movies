# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
🧐 📽️Project Suggested by DataCamp in the career of DataScientist with python made in JupyterNotebook.
You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office",
using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
With this project i gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. 
This will allow me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots that creat it of the data.
